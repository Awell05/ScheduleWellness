# ScheduleWellness

## Description
Try out my schedule planner! This challenge helped me gain knowledge in utilizing local storage and traversal of the DOM. I also was able to implement and learn utilizing third party API's. The challenge I faced were learning how to create logic to excute the function I needed. I plan to revist this challenge in add the function to save input information & have the time blocks change colors as the the day progresses.
